                        <h3>Personal Data Collected via Technology</h3>

                        <p>To make our Site, Products, and related services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by an offshore third-party service provider) collect Personal Data from you, such as browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. We may also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and which you viewed. Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this Personal Data and store it in log files each time you visit our website or access your account on our network. StartupCompass' gathering of personal information and demographic data is utilized solely for internal company purposes and to enhance the user experience. We do not share, sell, rent or otherwise distribute our client's personal information.</p>

                        <p>By making use of our Products, StartupCompass collects personally identifying information (such as name, title, physical address, email address) as well as underlying information to perform two operations in one. The product is able to tell a firm to which type it is and which stage it is in. This is called the Classification operation. Using this information, a set of benchmarks is generated for a firm using the cumulative knowledge of all firms who filled out the Startup Genome survey. This is called the benchmarking operation. Collecting the information is done using an online survey that was developed specifically for this purpose. Further details describing the development of the Products can be found in our methodology blog posts: Startup Genome Report, Machine Learning based Classification.</p>

                        <p>The collected information is used solely for the purposes disclosed in this privacy statement or on the page(s) of the Site where information is requested, unless you agree in advance to additional uses. StartupCompass takes care to safeguard user data by use of digital encryption. By using our Products and/or services, information can be shared solely on the basis of the agreement of both parties involved. Unless a user requests to exchange information with another user, and the other user accepts this exchange, no information may be shared. StartupCompass cannot be held responsible for any information exchange between users who have mutually agreed and committed to share information. Any exchange of information between users must be initiated by a user (the “Requesting Party”) and approved by another user (the “Consenting Party”). The exchange of information between the Requesting Party and the Consenting Party requires the Requesting Party to send an electronic request (the “Invitation”), which must be accepted by the Consenting Party. Exchange of user data is mutual and is subject to the approval of both the Requesting Party and the Consenting Party.</p>

                        <p>StartupCompass might use the names and email addresses to contact you to announce news, new product features or ask for feedback.

We do not use this information to personally track or identify you. Web analytic tools often track IP addresses and install cookies to measure user interactions. If you find this objectionable, you may be able to set your browser to block these cookies and disable tracking features typically used by third-party web site analytic services.
